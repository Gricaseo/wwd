## About CSV
A eazy to read and edit interchangeable format. You can even open it in Excel if you want.
The rows are separated by new lines and the columns are sepparated with commas. 

I went for the fields: Name, Series and Birthay but feel free to suggest better
or more relevant fields.

- Name order hasnt been decided yet.
- Dates should be in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
